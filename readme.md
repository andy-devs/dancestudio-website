## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   Helpful libraries: [InputMask](https://github.com/RobinHerbots/Inputmask), [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/), [JustValidate](https://github.com/horprogs/Just-validate)
-   [FormSubmit.io](https://formsubmit.co/) - Simple and useful website to submit a form to my email

### What I learned

I applied my layout skills and learned new ones. For example, working with libraries, applying validation and input mask for a form and creating modal menus.

### Continued development

Looking forward to push this project into real life!
